Pure OOP language which doesn't supports the feature called primitive datatypes like int,char,float bool etc

There are 7 qualities to be satisfied for a programming language to be object oriented they are:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1)Encapsulation/Data hiding
2)Inheritance
3)Polymorphism
4)Abstraction
5)All predefined types(primitive datatypes) are objects
6)All user defined types are objects
7)All operation performed on objects must be only through methods exposed at the objects

why java is not a pure oop bcz :java doesn't supports property 5 and 7 

And bellow reasons will explain why java is not a pure oop bcz
--------------------------------------------------------------
->Primitive datatypes ex.int, long, float, bool etc etc as objects:
    Smalltalk(programming language) is a pure oop unlike c++ and java aren't because
    , In Smalltalk primitive values such as integer, booleans and characters are also objects
    in java and c++ we have prdefined types called primitive datatypes(non-objects)
->The stataic keyword:
    If class is declared as a static then it can be used without the use of an object
    If we declare fuctions or variables as static then we need not to create object or we can call using class name or even we can call without reference of object.
->Wrapper class:
    Wrapper class provides the mechanism to convert primitive into object and object into primitive
    we can use Integer, Float etc instead of int, float etc.
    even if we use Wrapper classes java is not pure oop language, bcz internally it will
    use the operations like Unboxing and Autoboxing
    If we create Integer instead of int and do mathamatical operation on it, java is going to use
    primitive type int only
